            GoLayout provides a common super-class for auto-layout algorithms.

            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayout.PerformLayout"/> call update the positions of nodes and the
            paths of links in this Control's thread.
            The document changes that happen are more efficiently and (depending on your
            application) more safely performed in the thread handling events for your GoView.
            <see cref="E:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayout.Progress"/> event handlers will also be called in the view's thread.

        <member name="T:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutForceDirected">
            <summary>
            GoLayoutForceDirected provides an auto-layout algorithm for
            graphs which utilizes a force-directed method.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The graph is viewed as
            a system of bodies with forces acting between the bodies.  The algorithm
            seeks a configuration of the bodies with locally minimal energy, i.e.,
            a position such that the sum of the forces on each body is zero.
            </remarks>
            <example>
            Typical usage:
            <code>
            GoDocument doc = goView1.Document;
            doc.StartTransaction();
            GoLayoutForceDirected layout = new GoLayoutForceDirected();
            layout.Document = doc;
            // ...maybe set other properties...
            layout.PerformLayout();
            doc.FinishTransaction("layout");
            </code>
            To lay out only a portion of a document, you will need to construct
            a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutForceDirectedNetwork"/>, initialize it with just the
            nodes and links that you want to use, and set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutForceDirected.Network"/>
            property.
            <code>
            GoDocument doc = goView1.Document;
            doc.StartTransaction();
            GoLayoutForceDirected layout = new GoLayoutForceDirected();
            layout.Document = doc;
            layout.Network = layout.CreateNetwork();
            // if you want to start off with the network representing the complete document,
            // and then remove the nodes (or links) that you don't want:
            layout.Network.AddNodesAndLinksFromCollection(doc, true);
            foreach (GoObject obj in doc) {
              if (...obj is a node that you want to exclude from the layout...) {
                layout.Network.DeleteNode(obj);  // there is also a DeleteLink method
              }
            }
            // ...maybe set other properties...
            layout.PerformLayout();
            doc.FinishTransaction("layout");

            <remarks>
            This method can be overridden to customize the layout algorithm,

            After all of the computations are completed, this calls
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutForceDirected.LayoutNodesAndLinks"/> in order to commit the positions

            GoLayoutLayeredDigraph provides an auto-layout for layered drawings
            of directed graphs.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The method uses a hierarchical approach
            for creating drawings of digraphs with nodes arranged in layers.
            The layout algorithm consists of four-major steps: Cycle Removal,
            Layer Assignment, Crossing Reduction, and Straightening and Packing.
            </remarks>
            <example>
            Typical usage:
            <code>
            GoDocument doc = goView1.Document;
            doc.StartTransaction();
            GoLayoutLayeredDigraph layout = new GoLayoutLayeredDigraph();
            layout.Document = doc;
            layout.DirectionOption = GoLayoutDirection.Down;
            layout.ColumnSpacing = 15;
            layout.LayerSpacing = 10;
            // ...maybe set other properties...
            layout.PerformLayout();
            doc.FinishTransaction("layout");
            </code>
            To lay out only a portion of a document, you will need to construct
            a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutLayeredDigraphNetwork"/>, initialize it with just the
            nodes and links that you want to use, and set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutLayeredDigraph.Network"/>
            property.
            <code>
            GoDocument doc = goView1.Document;
            doc.StartTransaction();
            GoLayoutLayeredDigraph layout = new GoLayoutLayeredDigraph();
            layout.Document = doc;
            layout.Network = layout.CreateNetwork();
            // if you want to start off with the network representing the complete document,
            // and then remove the nodes (or links) that you don't want:
            layout.Network.AddNodesAndLinksFromCollection(doc, true);
            foreach (GoObject obj in doc) {
              if (...obj is a node that you want to exclude from the layout...) {
                layout.Network.DeleteNode(obj);  // there is also a DeleteLink method
              }
            }
            layout.DirectionOption = GoLayoutDirection.Down;
            layout.ColumnSpacing = 15;
            layout.LayerSpacing = 10;
            // ...maybe set other properties...
            layout.PerformLayout();
            doc.FinishTransaction("layout");

            adjacent layers between the unfixedLayer and its adjacent layers.
            The directionCR argument indicates which of the adjacent layers should be taken
            into consideration when reducing the number of link crossings.

            The LinkStraightenWeight attempts to give higher priority to links between
            "artificial" nodes; i.e., long links in the final layout will be straighter.

            This method should walk the tree recursively.
            The standard implementation gracefully handles shared nodes, including cyclical references.
            However, there can only be one <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTreeNode.Parent"/> per node.
            If a node is declared to be the child of multiple nodes, it is not guaranteed which
            node wins as the parent node.
            If any of the children of this node are in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTree.Roots"/> collection,
            they are removed from that collection.

            The values may be inherited, so this method is called while

            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTreeNode"/> in a depth-first manner starting at a root.
            You probably do not need to override this method,
            but if you do you should call first either the base method
            or <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTreeNode.CopyInheritedPropertiesFrom(Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTreeNode)"/>, since they
            assign most of the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTreeNode"/> property values
            used to influence the layout.
            Informational properties such as <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTreeNode.DescendentCount"/>
            and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTreeNode.MaxGenerationCount"/> will not yet have been initialized
            by the time this method is called.
            It is more common to override <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTree.AssignTreeNodeValues(Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTreeNode)"/> in order to

            Having a positive value is useful if you want to reserve space
            at the start of the row of children for some reason.
            For example, if you want to pretend the parent node is infinitely deep,
            you can set this to be the breadth of the parent node.

            <value>
            A value of zero (the default) means there is no limit;

            <para>
            This property is just a suggested constraint on how
            broadly the tree will be laid out.
            When there isn't enough breadth for all of the children of a node,
            the children are placed in as many rows as needed to try to stay
            within the given breadth limit.
            If the value is too small, since this layout algorithm
            does not modify the size or shape of any node, the nodes will
            just be laid out in a line, one per row, and the breadth is
            determined by the broadest node.
            The distance between rows is specified by <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTree.RowSpacing"/>.
            To make room for the links that go around earlier rows to get to
            later rows, when the alignment is not a "center" alignment, the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Layout.GoLayoutTree.RowIndent"/> property specifies that space at the
