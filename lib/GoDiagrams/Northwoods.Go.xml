            <summary>
            This graphical object provides a way to get the appearance and behavior
            from an existing Windows Forms <c>Control</c>.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            A <c>GoControl</c> is a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/> that manages a
            Windows Forms <c>Control</c> in a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>.
            The <c>Control</c> is automatically created when the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>
            becomes visible in the view, and is added to the view's <c>Controls</c>
            collection.  By default the <c>Control</c> has the same size
            as the <c>GoControl</c>, and it moves around or changes size
            on the screen as the <c>GoControl</c> is scrolled around or resized.
            </para>
            <para>
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.CreateControl(Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/> is responsible for creating an instance
            of a <c>Control</c>.  By default it just creates an instance of the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.ControlType"/> <c>Type</c>, and gives it the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoControl"/>'s
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Bounds"/> in view coordinates.
            </para>
            <para>
            This object keeps a hashtable mapping <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>'s to <c>Control</c>s.
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.FindControl(Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/> finds any <c>Control</c> for this <c>GoControl</c>
            in a given <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>.
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.GetControl(Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/> is responsible for making sure a <c>Control</c> exists;
            if <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.FindControl(Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/> returns null, it calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.CreateControl(Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The most common use of <c>GoControl</c>s is as in-place editors for a
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>.  <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/> for example, uses customized
            <c>TextBox</c>, <c>ComboBox</c>, and <c>NumericUpDown</c> <c>Control</c>s
            to allow the user to edit text.  When used as an editor, a <c>GoControl</c>
            is added to a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/> layer, not to a document.  The use of
            the <c>Control</c> managed by the <c>GoControl</c> is effectively modal.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.EditedObject"/> property is used when this <c>GoControl</c>
            is used as a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/> editor.  This <c>GoControl</c>
            becomes the value of <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.EditControl"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            However, you can also use <c>GoControl</c>s in <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument"/>s.
            When they are used as regular document objects, usually as part of a
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup"/>, a <c>Control</c> is created for each <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>
            in which the <c>GoControl</c> can be seen.
            Please be aware of the restrictions that are imposed by Windows Controls.
            Because each <c>Control</c>, including <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>, is responsible
            for completely painting itself and handling all events that it receives,
            it is not possible to interleave the painting done by <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>
            and the painting done by <c>Control</c>s.
            All <c>Controls</c> that are parented by a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/> must appear
            in front of the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/> itself.
            Hence two <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup"/>s that each contain a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoControl"/>
            and that overlap each other will produce the odd effect of not having one
            group properly appear in front of the other one, because the <c>Control</c>s
            managed by the nested <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoControl"/>s are in front of everything
            that the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/> paints.
            </para>
            <para>
            Besides having all <c>Control</c>s appear in front of all <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>s,
            the use of <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoControl"/> has additional limitations and difficulties of use.
            You will need to handle the initialization of the <c>Control</c>, given information
            that is present on or accessible from the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoControl"/> or its
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Parent"/> or <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.ParentNode"/>.
            This is often done in the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoControlObject"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoControlObject.GoControl"/>
            setter, if you subclass the <c>Control</c> and implement the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoControlObject"/>
            interface.  Or you can do the initialization in a call from an override
            of <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.CreateControl(Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Another limitation is that your application will need to deal with focus
            issues, scaling, and printing, and synchronization.
            Printing, in particular, is not naturally supported by Windows Forms controls.
            And at the current time, scaling <c>Control</c>s is not performed in a good manner.
            And if you have a <c>GoControl</c> visible in two <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>s
            at the same time, you will need to deal with synchronization issues between
            the two <c>Control</c>s that are created for the single <c>GoControl</c> object.
            </para>
            <para>
            For simplicity, <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.Paint(System.Drawing.Graphics,Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/> does not call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoControl.GetControl(Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/>
            to make sure a <c>Control</c> exists in a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoOverview"/>.
            Instead it just paints a gray rectangle.

            You should override this method in your derived classes when it has some
            fields that have reference objects that need to be copied.
            Your override method should first call <c>base.CopyObject(env)</c>

            The standard implementation of this method for <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>

            and after removing references that should not be shared (such as to
            cached data structures).
            If <c>base.CopyObject(env)</c> returns null, it's either already copied,

            If the natural location of an object is not the top-left corner,
            changing the size of an object will also change its location.
            However, there are times when you wish to change the size without
            changing the location.
            This method is more efficient than remembering the Location,
            setting the Size, and then setting the Location again.
            By default this assumes the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Location"/> is really the
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.TopLeft"/> spot of the object.

            which records the old and new values so that it can perform undo and redo
            operations.

            If <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.SuspendsUpdates"/> is true (it is normally false of course),
            this method does nothing.  Your override of this method should check for
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.SuspendsUpdates"/> before invoking any updating functionality.
            If this object is part of a layer, it calls
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.IGoLayerCollectionContainer.RaiseChanged(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Object,System.Int32,System.Object,System.Drawing.RectangleF,System.Int32,System.Object,System.Drawing.RectangleF)"/>
            with a hint of <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoLayer"/>.<see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoLayer.ChangedObject"/>.
            If there are any observers watching changes to this object,
            this method calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.OnObservedChanged(Northwoods.Go.GoObject,System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Object,System.Drawing.RectangleF,System.Int32,System.Object,System.Drawing.RectangleF)"/> on each of this object's

            the caller of <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.CopyObject(Northwoods.Go.GoCopyDictionary)"/> is responsible for doing so, just as with

            Use of the observer mechanism is less efficient in both space and time

            The <paramref name="view"/> parameter is useful for customizing
            the drawing behavior based on the kind of view to which we are drawing.
            For example, the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.ShadowOffset"/> property specifies 
            the size of the drop shadow painted by objects whose <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Shadowed"/>
            property is true.

            If you override this method, you may also need to override <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.ExpandPaintBounds(System.Drawing.RectangleF,Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/>,
            and perhaps the other geometry methods, including <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.ComputeBounds"/>,

            Furthermore, in the implementation of a property setter that causes the paint bounds
            to change, you will need to call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.InvalidateViews"/> before actually
            changing your object's state, so that views will get a chance to notice the
            paint bounds before it changes.

             Although properties should be designed so that setting one property
             does not modify other properties, this is sometimes not practical.
             Nevertheless it is important to avoid having side-effects when
             the value is changing due to an undo or redo.
             One way of doing this is to copy the needed code, but not the
             auxiliary side-effecting code, from the property setter to the
             <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.ChangeValue(Northwoods.Go.GoChangedEventArgs,System.Boolean)"/> override.  Or you could define
             a method called from both the setter and the ChangeValue method,
             parameterized by whether the caller is the setter or not.
             </para>
             <para>
             But a more convenient way to achieve this is to check the
             <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Initializing"/> property that is set to true when the
             <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.ChangeValue(Northwoods.Go.GoChangedEventArgs,System.Boolean)"/> method is being called on this object.
             You should check this property before making "unrelated" side-effects.

            This property is normally the object's <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.TopLeft"/> position.
            However, it is common for certain kinds of objects to assume that the
            assigned location actually refers to a different spot of the bounding
            rectangle.  For example, for <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/> objects, the text's
            alignment property determines the <c>Location</c>.  For groups, one of
            the child objects might be the natural thing to be positioned as the
            user would see it.  For example, the icon of a node might provide the
            Location for the node as a whole.
            If you override this property, you should also override
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.SetSizeKeepingLocation(System.Drawing.SizeF)"/>.

            This defaults to true.
            You should normally call the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.CanView"/> method
            instead of getting this property.
            If you set this property to false, you probably also want to set
            the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Printable"/> property to false.
            </value>
            <remarks>
            A false value prevents the user from seeing this object
            by the normal painting mechanisms.
            Even when this property value is true, this object might not be
            seeable by the user because the object's layer is not visible.
            A user will not normally be able to select an invisible object
            or do other interactive operations with an invisible object.
            However, an invisible object can still be part of a layer and
            document or view, and can still take part in all programmatic
            operations such as manipulating its bounds.

            Sometimes when handling certain events you need to know whether the

            This property is provided as a standard way to indicate that the object

            Most of the simpler objects do not need to use this flag.
            More complicated objects such as <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup"/>s use this flag

            So if you temporarily set this property to true during the initialization of a

            <remarks>
            Sometimes when an object gets selected, you want to make it look like
            another object is what really got selected.
            Normally this happens for groups, where you don't want to have selection
            handles on the whole group, but only on some particular child object.
            This property allows you to specify which object should get selection
            handles when this object gains selection.
            The default value is this object itself.
            The selection object's <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.CanResize"/> method will control if that
            object gets resize selection handles and if the user can actually resize
            that object.
            You should be careful to make sure the value of this property is
            not confusing to the user.  Returning unrelated or varying objects
            may produce indeterminate behavior.

            As with brushes, you can set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.Pen"/> property to any of the predefined
            <b>System.Drawing.Pens</b>, or you can construct your own <b>Pen</b>.
            Be sure to construct and completely initialize the <b>Pen</b> before assigning
            it to the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.Pen"/> property -- you may not modify a <b>Pen</b>

            This shape class, the most capable of the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoShape"/>s, is a
            generalization of the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoPolygon"/> and <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoStroke"/> classes.
            You can also rotate or flip a drawing, extract figures as drawings, or
            insert other shapes as figures.
            The <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoFigure"/> enumeration specifies a number of predefined drawings.
            </para>
            <para>
            The term "figure" is used in two different but related ways here.
            Inside a GoDrawing there can be more than one figure, where each figure is a
            closed or open series of straight or curved segments.
            Although most <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoFigure"/> enumerations specify <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing"/>s consisting
            of a single figure, some of the more complicated <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoFigure"/>s specify
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing"/>s that contain multiple figures.
            </para>
            <para>
            The most common usage is to just use the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.#ctor(Northwoods.Go.GoFigure)"/>
            constructor, followed by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.BrushColor"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.PenColor"/>, or other <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoShape"/> properties.
            Remember that an instance of a GoDrawing is a single <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoShape"/>,
            with a single <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.Brush"/> and a single <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.Pen"/>
            covering the whole shape.
            </para>
            <para>
            You can define your own drawings by specifying the points and the nature of each
            segment, along with whether each figure is open or closed.
            In a manner similar to drawing with a pencil, for each figure you want to create,
            call the <c>StartAt</c> method, call <c>LineTo</c> and/or <c>CurveTo</c> as many
            times as you need, followed by a call to <c>CloseFigure</c> if you want that figure
            to be a closed path and potentially filled by the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.Brush"/>.
            For example, this produces an open shape consisting of two curves:
            <code>
            GoDrawing s = new GoDrawing();
            s.StartAt(50, 50);
            s.CurveTo(75, 75, 100, 100, 50, 150);
            s.CurveTo(100, 150, 150, 100, 200, 200);
            </code>
            This produces a square with two curved lines connecting the top-left corner
            with the bottom-right corner:
            <code>
            GoDrawing s = new GoDrawing();
            s.StartAt(50, 50);
            s.LineTo(150, 50);
            s.LineTo(150, 150);
            s.LineTo(50, 150);
            s.LineTo(50, 50);
            s.CurveTo(125, 75, 125, 75, 150, 150);
            s.CurveTo(75, 125, 75, 125, 50, 50);
            s.CloseFigure();
            s.BrushColor = Color.Green;
            </code>
            The above drawing is completely filled by the green color.
            If you had not called <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.CloseFigure"/>, no brush would be painted
            in that figure.  Users could only pick this drawing by clicking along the lines.
            </para>
            <para>
            If you call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.CloseFigure"/> and also set <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.FillMode"/>

            Here's an example of creating a drawing with three figures: two squares
            connected by a line.
            <code>
            GoDrawing s = new GoDrawing();
            s.StartAt(50, 50);
            s.LineTo(100, 50);
            s.LineTo(100, 100);
            s.LineTo(50, 100);
            s.CloseFigure();
            s.StartAt(150, 50);
            s.LineTo(200, 50);
            s.LineTo(200, 100);
            s.LineTo(150, 100);
            s.CloseFigure();
            s.StartAt(100, 75);
            s.LineTo(150, 75);
            s.FillSimpleGradient(Color.Green, GoObject.MiddleLeft);
            </code>
            Note that the gradient extends all the way from the left side to the right side.
            The left square is relatively light colored; the right square is relatively dark.

            You can rotate a drawing by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.Angle"/> property.
            Or you can rotate about any point by calling <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.Rotate(System.Drawing.PointF,System.Single)"/>,
            which will also set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.Angle"/>.  Please note that changing
            the angle may very well change the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Bounds"/>, including
            the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Position"/>.  You can get the bounds of this drawing
            as if the angle were zero by using the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.UnrotatedBounds"/> property.
            Just setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.Angle"/> property will rotate the drawing about
            the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.UnrotatedCenter"/> -- the center of the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.UnrotatedBounds"/>.

            Adjacent curved segments may meet at an angle.  Sometimes you would like to make sure
            that curves remain smooth between two curved segments, even when the user reshapes
            the points.  You can set <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.SmoothCurves"/>, or call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.MakeSmoothCurves"/>.
            But note that curved segments will still form angles with an adjacent straight line segments.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are also methods for modifying individual points, for inserting segments into an
            existing figure, for opening or closing existing figures, for inserting whole shapes as
            figures into a drawing, and for extracting figures from a drawing into a new GoDrawing.

            <para>
            The basic points and segment style and figure information is stored in a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawingData"/>,
            accessible via the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.Data"/> property.  This information is used to construct
            a <c>GraphicsPath</c> in the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.MakePath"/> method.

            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.PointsCount"/> property returns the number of points in the whole drawing.

            <para>
            Since it is hard for a user to pick a figure when they have to precisely target pixels
            where the line is drawn, the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.ContainsPoint(System.Drawing.PointF)"/> predicate allows for a certain
            amount of leeway.  This is governed by the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing.PickMargin"/> property.

            <remarks>
            A <c>GoGrid</c> is not a table containing cells of objects.
            This class just draws lines in a regular manner within the bounds of
            this object according to a frequency specified by the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoGrid.CellSize"/>.
            The appearance of the lines is governed by the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoGrid.Style"/>
            and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoGrid.LineWidth"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoGrid.LineColor"/>.
            You can also specify a regular pattern of colors by specifying <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoGrid.CellColors"/>.
            Furthermore a grid can have a semi-infinite or infinite extent by
            setting <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoGrid.UnboundedSpots"/>.
            This class also implements the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoDragSnapper"/> interface,

            This method is responsible for copying and adding this group's
            child objects to the <paramref name="newgroup"/>.
            By default, this simply calls
            <c>newgroup.Add(env.Copy(obj))</c> for each child <c>obj</c>.
            However, your group subclass may want to keep track of some or all
            of the children for its own purposes.  To that end you can override
            this method to do the copying manually, thereby correctly maintaining
            your subclass's internal pointers to children.
            You probably should not be calling <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>'s <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.CopyObject(Northwoods.Go.GoCopyDictionary)"/>,
            but <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoCopyDictionary"/>'s <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoCopyDictionary.Copy(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>
            or indexed lookup instead.
            </remarks>
            <example>
            For example, a group holding an Icon, a Label, an InPort, and an OutPort
            might implement this method as follows:
            <code>
            base.CopyChildren(newgroup, env);
            MyNode newnode = (MyNode)newgroup;
            newnode.myIcon = (GoObject)env[myIcon];
            newnode.myLabel = (GoText)env[myLabel];
            newnode.myInPort = (GoPort)env[myInPort];
            newnode.myOutPort = (GoPort)env[myOutPort];
            </code>
            Note that this indexing use of <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoCopyDictionary"/> can handle null
            references--it returns null.

            will be the same as this group's layer.
            When you add an object to a group, you will normally make that child object
            not <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Selectable"/>.
            If the child is supposed to be selectable, you need to consider whether users
            can move or copy the child on its own, or whether this parent group should be
            moved or copied instead.  For the latter case you should set the
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.DragsNode"/> property to true for each such child, so
            that <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.DraggingObject"/> will return the child's parent node.
            If instead you want to allow selected children to be able to move on their own,
            you should make sure <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup.LayoutChildren(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/> does not control the positioning

            This method makes the <paramref name="newobj"/> be in the group at the position
            after the <paramref name="child"/>, so that the <paramref name="newobj"/>
            will be painted immediately after the <paramref name="child"/>.
            If the <paramref name="newobj"/> already belonged to this group, only its
            position in the list is changed.
            The <paramref name="newobj"/> must not already be part of a different group or be
            a top-level object in some layer.
            The existing <paramref name="child"/> must be either null or a member of this
            group (but not be the same as <paramref name="newobj"/>).
            If the <paramref name="child"/> is null, the <paramref name="newobj"/>
            is added at the end of the list, in front of all other objects in this group.

            Implementations of this method probably should not refer, directly or
            indirectly, to this group's <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Bounds"/> property.
            Instead, you should just position and size the children based on the
            bounds of the children (not this group's bounds), and let this
            group's bounds be determined by the union of the bounds of the children.

            check the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Initializing"/> flag.  If true, this method

            <remarks>
            Although this structure is public, it is rarely used explicitly.
            Instead you should use the <c>foreach</c> (or <c>For Each</c>) construct to
            iterate through the children of a group.  In C#:
            <code>
            foreach (GoObject obj in aGroup) {
              . . .
            }
            </code>
            In VB.NET:
            <code>
            Dim obj As GoObject
            For Each obj in aGroup
              . . .
            Next
            </code>
            Also, since <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup"/> implements the <c>IList</c> interface,
            you can refer to the items of the group by a zero-based index.
            <para>
            Remember that you must not modify the group collection, by adding,
            removing, or re-ordering the child objects, while you are
            iterating over the children.
            This structure type does not support comparison for equality.

            <para>
            This <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/> is responsible for painting an <b>Image</b>.

            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.ImageList"/>, and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.Index"/> properties
            are used by <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.LoadImage"/> in order to procure the
            actual <b>Image</b> that is painted.
            If you change any of these properties, <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.LoadImage"/>
            will be called again to find a new image.
            </para>
            <para>
            When you set any of those properties,
            if <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.AutoResizes"/> is true (which is the default value),
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.LoadImage"/> will be called immediately to determine
            whether the new <b>Image</b> has a new <b>Size</b>, in order to
            resize this <b>GoImage</b> object to the <b>Image</b>'s natural size.
            However, when <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.AutoResizes"/> is false, <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.LoadImage"/>

            Hence if you have a large diagram with many different <b>Image</b>s

            on demand due to painting.  You can achieve this effect by setting

            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.DefaultResourceManager"/> instead.
            If no <b>Image</b> is found in any <b>ResourceManager</b> for the
            given name, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.Name"/> is treated as a URI to be gotten
            via a <b>WebClient</b> if <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoImage.NameIsUri"/> is true, or as a

            first calling the base method and then looking at the <c>Control</c>,
            as follows:

            That initialization is normally done when <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoControlObject.GoControl"/>

            It will of course want to examine this <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/> object being edited;

            change the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoText.Text"/> property, it is best to do something like:
            <code>
              GoControl goctrl = this.GoControl;
              if (goctrl != null) {

                }
              }
            </code>
            This calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoText.DoEdit(Northwoods.Go.GoView,System.String,System.String)"/> which permits validation using both the old and the

            The new value may be null, to simply remove the port.

            Setting this property to a new port will also set that port's

            Instead of setting the port after creating a node, you may find it
            easier to override the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoBasicNode.CreatePort"/> method.

            A GoBoxNode has a single rectangular port that surrounds another object, named the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoBoxNode.Body"/>.
            This is most useful when that body object is basically rectangular, and when links
            can connect at any side, determined dynamically.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            This class uses a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoBoxPort"/> to allow links to come in orthogonally
            and (optionally) be positioned intelligently apart from each other.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoBoxNode.Port"/> is slightly larger than the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoBoxNode.Body"/>, so that it appears as if
            it were a border for the body object.  Thus users can start drawing links
            by mouse-down and dragging along the edge of the GoBoxNode.
            You can customize the appearance of that "border" by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoBoxNode.Port"/>'s
            properties.  For example:
            <code>
            GoBoxNode node1 = new GoBoxNode();
            node1.Text = "box node\n1";
            node1.Label.Alignment = GoObject.Middle;
            node1.Port.PenColor = Color.Black;
            node1.Port.BrushColor = Color.Pink;
            node1.PortBorderMargin = new SizeF(6, 6);
            node1.LinksPointsSpread = true;

            In this case you may find it advantageous to override the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoNode.Label"/>

            <remarks>
            <para>
            A port is an object to which one or more links may be connected.
            Ports are normally part of a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoNode"/>,
            although they may also be part of a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoLabeledLink"/>.
            A node will only need more than one port when you want to make sure there is a
            logical distinction between the links or when you want to position the
            links connections at one physical location.  Both reasons apply, for example,
            when wanting to represent an electronic logic gate or arithmetic or database
            operator: you don't want to confuse where each input is getting its value from.
            </para>
            <para>
            Since GoPort inherits from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoShape"/>, it is easy to customize
            the appearance of a port by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.BrushColor"/> and/or the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.PenColor"/> properties.  The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.Style"/> property
            controls the shape of the port within the port's bounds.
            The default style is <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoPortStyle.Ellipse"/>.  When the style is
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoPortStyle.None"/>, nothing is painted for the port, but it
            continues to behave normally.
            </para>
            <para>
            A less common approach to providing a port appearance is to specify a style
            that is <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoPortStyle.Object"/>.  For this case you will need to
            set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.PortObject"/> property to refer to a <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.GoObject"/>
            that is not part of any group or layer.  This <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.PortObject"/> may be
            shared by many ports.
            When there is a port object, the appearance comes totally from that object --
            the port's brush and pen are ignored.  You'll need to make sure that that
            object can be resized to the same size as the port.  If you use a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/>
            as a port object, be sure to either set <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoText.AutoResizes"/> true,
            or resize the port to be able to show all of the text.
            </para>
            <para>
            The links that are attached to a port are conceptually divided into two categories:
            ones that come into the port, and ones that go out from the port.  But often you
            won't care about the direction, so some of the properties and methods apply to all links.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.SourceLinks"/> property allows you to enumerate the links that are
            coming into a port -- e.g. the links whose <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoLink.ToPort"/> is this port.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.DestinationLinks"/> property allows you to enumerate the links that are
            going out of a port -- e.g. the links whose <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoLink.FromPort"/> is this port.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.Links"/> property allows you to enumerate all links connected at this port.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.SourceLinksCount"/>, <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.DestinationLinksCount"/>, and
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.LinksCount"/> properties give you the size of each of those three collections.
            The User Guide provides examples for how to traverse a graph.
            </para>
            <para>
            GoPort provides a fair bit of control for where and how each link will appear
            to connect to it.
            The most common case is that links connect at a particular spot on the port,
            usually the middle of some side.  You can get this behavior by setting the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.FromSpot"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.ToSpot"/> properties.
            For example, setting <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.FromSpot"/> to <c>GoObject.MiddleRight</c>
            will cause all destination links to come out of the port at the middle of the right side.
            Similarly, you can set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.ToSpot"/> to be the same spot, or perhaps
            a different spot, say <c>GoObject.MiddleLeft</c> if you want links to go
            into the port from the left side.
            When the spot(s) are set in this manner, each link will have a short end segment
            at the port.
            </para>
            <para>
            More generally, you can override the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.GetToLinkPoint(Northwoods.Go.IGoLink)"/> and/or
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.GetFromLinkPoint(Northwoods.Go.IGoLink)"/> methods to control the exact end point for the link,
            for source links and for destination links, respectively.
            Similarly, you can override the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.GetToLinkDir(Northwoods.Go.IGoLink)"/> and/or
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.GetFromLinkDir(Northwoods.Go.IGoLink)"/> methods to control what direction each link's end
            segment should travel.
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.GetEndSegmentLength(Northwoods.Go.IGoLink,System.Boolean)"/> controls how long each end segment should be,
            assuming there is one at all.  If the port spot is <c>GoObject.NoSpot</c>,
            there usually won't be an end segment in the link at that port.

            Many applications do not want to permit the user to draw links between any two ports.
            There are semantic rules that may make linking particular pairs of ports invalid.
            Or there may be some ports for which only one direction link may be connected.
            You can easily specify the most common restrictions by setting one or more of the
            following properties: <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.IsValidFrom"/>, <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.IsValidTo"/>,
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.IsValidSelfNode"/>, <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.IsValidDuplicateLinks"/>, and
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.IsValidSingleLink"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            For the most general or dynamic cases, you can override the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.IsValidLink(Northwoods.Go.IGoPort)"/>
            method, either here on <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoPort"/>, or on the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolLinkingNew"/>
            and <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolRelinking"/> tools associated with your <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>.
            Also consider setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.ValidCycle"/> property.

            point and direction at which links connect, so that they will now appear to be
            connected to the subgraph port.
            Also please note that by default <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.CreatePort"/> returns null/nothing,
            so a subgraph will not have a port unless you either override that method to return
            a new port or you assign the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.Port"/> property.

            This interface specifies ways for the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolAction"/> tool to
            invoke actions on objects.  
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Tools (<see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoTool"/>) are ways to easily specify behavior in response
            to mouse events for a whole <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>.
            To have a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/> specify mouse-event behavior, have your
            object subclass implement this interface, and make sure the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>'s
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.MouseDownTools"/> list starts with an instance of
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolAction"/>, as it does by default.
            The <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolAction"/> will handle mouse events and set the
            properties and invoke the methods of the object implementing this interface.
            Typically this will be some object where a click (and perhaps a drag)
            should execute some code.  One such class is <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoButton"/>.

            The icon is the primary part--the node labels are placed just above

            The ports go on their respective sides of the icon, positioned
            contiguously and centered vertically.  The ports are always next to
            the icon, and their respective labels are expected to be outside,
            as determined by <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoGeneralNodePort.LayoutLabel"/>.
            If there are too many ports to fit alongside the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoGeneralNode.Icon"/>,
            the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoGeneralNode.Icon"/> is stretched, unless the icon's

            all of the left/right and up/down directions are exchanged.

            This class provides a standard implementation of <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoLink"/>
            as a <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.GoObject"/>.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            A GoLink is a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoStroke"/> that connects two <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoPort"/>s.
            Make a link by constructing a link, setting both the <see ref="FromPort"/>
            and the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.ToPort"/>, setting any other properties you want on the link,
            and adding the link to your <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument"/>.
            Setting the two port properties will automatically add the link to each port's
            collection of links.
            Remove a link by calling <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.Unlink"/>.
            That will automatically disconnect the link from both of its ports.
            <para>
            A link does not own either port to which it is connected  -- ports are
            normally owned by nodes.
            Ports hold references to the links that are connected to them -- they do
            not own the links.
            </para>
            <para>
            The appearance of a link is determined by the stroke <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoStroke.Style"/>,
            by the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.Pen"/>, as well as by various link properties.
            Any filled arrowheads are painted by the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoShape.Brush"/>.
            Many examples are presented in the User Guide.
            </para>
            <para>
            The path of a link is determined by the points in its stroke, as plotted by
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.CalculateStroke"/>.  For links of <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoStroke.Style"/>
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoStrokeStyle.Bezier"/>, it takes the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoStroke.Curviness"/> into
            account to automatically give the link a curve.
            </para>
            <para>
            When the link is <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.Orthogonal"/>, it is common to set the style to
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoStrokeStyle.RoundedLine"/>.  Then the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoStroke.Curviness"/>
            property controls the size of the corners in the link.
            </para>
            <para>
            Whenever either port is moved (normally because the port's parent node moved),
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.CalculateStroke"/> is called again.  By default this will calculate
            all of the stroke points again.  However, if you set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.AdjustingStyle"/>
            property, <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.CalculateStroke"/> will take the old path into account
            in calculating the new path.
            </para>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            Typical programmatic usage might be something like:

            GoBasicNode node1 = new GoBasicNode();
            node1.LabelSpot = GoObject.Middle;

            node2.LabelSpot = GoObject.Middle;
            node2.Text = "basic node 2";
            node2.Shape.BrushColor = Color.LightYellow;
            node2.Location = new PointF(200, 50);
            goView1.Document.Add(node2);
            
            GoLink link = new GoLink();
            link.ToArrow = true;
            link.FromPort = node1.Port;

            The standard stroke path is determined by properties of this link
            and of the two ports it is connected to.
            If both ports are <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoPort"/>s, by default this method

            and the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.ToPort"/>'s <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPort.ToSpot"/>.
            If both spots are <c>GoObject.NoSpot</c>, this link's stroke
            will consist of two points determined by calling

            <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoStrokeStyle.Bezier"/>--the points are plotted according
            to the value of <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoStroke.Curviness"/>.)
            If both spots have "spots" (i.e. not <c>GoObject.NoSpot</c>), 
            there will be four points in the stroke, resulting in
            three straight line segments, unless <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.Orthogonal"/> is

            <remarks>
            This property primarily controls the behavior of <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.CalculateStroke"/>,
            to position the points of the stroke so that straight line segments will
            be horizontal or vertical.
            You can have a link drawn with only horizontal and vertical segments if the
            link's stroke style is <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoStrokeStyle.Line"/> or
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoStrokeStyle.RoundedLine"/>.
            If the stroke style is <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoStrokeStyle.Bezier"/>, some of the orthogonally
            positioned points act as control points to help form the curve.
            The orthogonal <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.CalculateStroke"/> algorithm adds two segments to
            the normal three segments so that it is possible to connect two ports using only
            orthogonal lines.
            Changing this value will call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoLink.PortsOnLinkChanged(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Object,System.Drawing.RectangleF,System.Int32,System.Object,System.Drawing.RectangleF)"/> to notify

            Setting this property to true will clear any existing points and then call

            <para>
            Call the <c>Initialize</c> method to construct the standard parts of this kind of node.
            The ports are normally on the left side and on the right side of the icon,
            and the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Label"/> is on the bottom.
            If you set <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Orientation"/> to <c>Orientation.Vertical</c>, the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.InPort"/> will be on top and the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.OutPort"/> will be on the bottom,
            and the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Label"/> will be on the right side.
            In order to remove either port you can set either <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.InPort"/> or
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.OutPort"/> to null, or you can call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Remove"/> on the port.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Icon"/> is normally a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoNodeIcon"/>,
            but could be any kind of <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>.
            When it is a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoImage"/>, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Image"/> property gives you
            convenient access to the icon's image properties.
            The image will normally be sized at <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.MinimumIconSize"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            When then first two arguments to <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Initialize(System.Resources.ResourceManager,System.String,System.String)"/>
            are null, the node is initialized to use a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing"/> instead of a
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoImage"/>.  After initialization you can set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Figure"/>
            property if you want to display one of the standard <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoFigure"/>s.
            </para>
            <para>
            You can also set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Icon"/> to be any kind of <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>,
            including other kinds of <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoShape"/>s.  The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Shape"/> property
            provides convenient access to the icon when it is a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoShape"/>, to allow
            you to initialize its brush and/or pen.  If your icon is a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup"/>,
            it might be convenient to override <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Shape"/> and perhaps <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSimpleNode.Figure"/>
            to refer to the appropriate shape or drawing in the group.
            </para>
            <para>
            Remember that <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoPort"/> also inherits from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoShape"/>,
            so you can easily set the brush and/or pen, as well as setting the port's

            When the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.LabelSpot"/> refers to a corner, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.Label"/> is
            actually positioned above or below the subgraph, much like headers or footers in
            a page layout.  Furthermore, when the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.LabelSpot"/> is
            <see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.TopLeft"/>, if there is a <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.Handle"/> and it is
            at exactly the same position, the label is shifted right to avoid the overlap.
            If this node is not <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.IsExpanded"/>, the label is positioned according
            to the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.CollapsedLabelSpot"/>.
            If there is a <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.CollapsedObject"/> the label is positioned relative
            to that collapsed object; otherwise it is positioned relative to the result of
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.ComputeCollapsedRectangle(System.Drawing.SizeF)"/>.

            <para>
            You can override this method to locate the label in customized places.
            But note that the default behavior of <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.ComputeInsideMarginsSkip(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/> is to
            include the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.Label"/> in the background/border decoration as computed by
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.ComputeBorder"/>.  If you want the label to be
            positioned outside of the border decoration, you will need to
            override <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.ComputeInsideMarginsSkip(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/> as follows:
            <code>
            protected override bool ComputeInsideMarginsSkip(GoObject child) {
              if (child == this.Label &amp;&amp; this.IsExpanded) return true;
              return base.ComputeInsideMarginsSkip(child);
            }
            </code>
            This example override will cause the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.Label"/> not to necessarily
            be inside the border when the subgraph is expanded.

            Unlike <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.ComputeBounds"/>, this method is used to calculate the expected size of

            and <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.FinishCollapse(System.Drawing.RectangleF)"/> with the intended collapsed bounds.
            The size of each child (that is not skipped by <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.ComputeCollapsedSizeSkip(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>)

            except for nested subgraphs, where <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.ComputeCollapsedSize(System.Boolean)"/> is called recursively.
            This method does not augment the size to include the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraph.CollapsedTopLeftMargin"/>

            The reason is that the standard behavior wants to insure that all links connected to child nodes

            <summary>
            A node displaying a string with a background and four ports, one at the
            middle of each side.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            If you don't need all four ports, you can remove ones you don't want by
            setting the corresponding property to null.
            </para>
            <para>
            You can change the background from a light-gray rectangle by setting
            the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Background"/> property to be some other object.  In order for
            the text to fit nicely within the shape, you may need to set the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.TopLeftMargin"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.BottomRightMargin"/> properties
            to larger values.  This is particularly true if the new shape is a
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoEllipse"/> or a polygon that has a small rectangular area in it.
            </para>
            <para>
            When <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.AutoResizes"/> is false, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Label"/> is sized to
            fit inside the bounds of the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Background"/>, minus the margins.
            The label (a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/>) is automatically wrapped and clipped.
            </para>
            <para>
            To make it easier to initialize or modify the shape's brush and/or pen,
            the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Shape"/> property casts the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Background"/> to a
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoShape"/>.  If you make the background a group of various
            kind of objects, you may want to override the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Shape"/> property
            to return the particular shape inside the group that you consider to be
            the most prominent.
            </para>
            <para>
            The text string is normally multiline and not editable, but you can change
            those and other properties by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Label"/>'s properties.
            </para>
            <para>
            Setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Shadowed"/> property for this node actually sets that
            property on the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Background"/> object.
            Although the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoTextNode.Background"/> object is normally a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoRectangle"/>,
            it could be any kind of <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>.

            This tool supports both automatic and manual panning in a view.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            When autopanning, this remembers an initial panning point and
            then autoscrolls the view in the direction of the
            current mouse point relative to the original panning point.
            This tool can be used in either a modal or a mode-less manner.
            To use modally, where the first mouse click will establish the
            panning origin, mouse moves determine autopanning direction
            and speed, and the second mouse up will stop the tool:
            <code>
              aView.Tool = new GoToolPanning(aView);
            </code>
            If you set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Origin"/> before the tool starts,
            the first mouse click is not needed.
            <code>
              GoToolPanning tool = new GoToolPanning(aView);
              tool.Origin = aView.LastInput.ViewPoint;  // or another point in the view
              aView.Tool = tool;
            </code>
            <para>
            It is started mode-lessly when the user presses the middle
            mouse button, which is normally the mouse wheel.  An instance
            of this tool is in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.MouseDownTools"/> list.
            </para>
            <para>
            For manual panning, you will need to create a separate instance
            of this class and set <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.AutoPan"/> to false.
            Then the user's left-mouse down and drag and up will pan the view.
            When you set the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Modal"/> property, this tool will
            remain in this mode even after the user does a mouse up.
            They can cancel this mode by pressing the Cancel key.
            </para>
            <para>
            By default no manual-panning tool is installed in a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>.
            To implement a "Manual Pan" command:
            <code>
            GoToolPanning panningtool = new GoToolPanning(myView);
            panningtool.AutoPan = false;
            panningtool.Modal = true;
            myView.Tool = panningtool;
            </code>
            However, if you do not need the user to do multiple selections by
            using the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolRubberBanding"/> tool,
            you may find it nicer to use the manual panning tool
            in a mode-less manner, so that the user can use all the other standard tools
            in a natural fashion.
            <code>
            GoToolPanning panningtool = new GoToolPanning(myView);
            panningtool.AutoPan = false;
            myView.MouseDownTools.Add(panningtool);
            </code>
            Both <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolRubberBanding"/> and this <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning"/>
            (when <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.AutoPan"/> is false) are started when the user does a
            mouse-down and drag in the background, so those two tools would conflict.
            But the user can still do multiple selections by using Shift- or Control-click.
            </para>
            <para>
            However, in ASP.NET WebForms, the panning gesture consists of
            only a single mouse-down, drag, mouse-up.  Since mouse moves
            are only simulated on WebForms, and auto-panning is not
            possible with no mouse time information and no immediate feedback,
            a simpler gesture is easier to use.  This results in just a
            single scroll, according to the distance and direction
            between the <c>FirstInput.ViewPoint</c> and <c>LastInput.ViewPoint</c>.
            </para>
            <para>
            So for WebForms, the default (modeless) panning tool that is installed
            as a <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.MouseDownTools"/> is not an auto-panning tool
            but a manual one: <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.AutoPan"/> is false.  It uses the middle
            mouse button instead of the left mouse button.  Only when <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Modal"/>
            is true, so that the user is in a special "panning mode", does the left mouse
            button start and perform the pan.  If you want to let the user pan
            the GoDiagram Web view with the left mouse button in a modeless fashion,
            rather than with the middle mouse button, remove the rubberband selection tool:
            <c>goView1.ReplaceMouseTool(typeof(GoToolRubberBanding), null);</c>

            <remarks>
            However, for manual panning on WebForms, the left mouse button
            is expected only when <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Modal"/> is true.
            When used modelessly, the middle button must be used, since the
            whole operation will consist of a background-mouse-down and a mouse-up,
            and that gesture will not be confused with a background rubber-band
            selection.

            When manually panning (i.e. <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.AutoPan"/> is false),

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            When autopanning, until the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Origin"/> panning point is set, this method
            does nothing.
            When manually panning, this changes the view's <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.DocPosition"/>
            along with changes of the mouse position in the view, thereby panning the view.
            However, when <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.AutoPan"/> is false and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Modal"/> is true,
            mouse moves have no effect unless a drag is in progress--i.e. after a mouse down.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            For WinForms, when autopanning, if the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Origin"/> has already been set,
            a mouse up just stops this tool.
            When manually panning, a mouse up just stops this tool, unless
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Modal"/> is true, in which case this tool waits for a mouse
            down again to start panning during mouse moves.
            </para>
            <para>
            For WebForms, the behavior is different.
            When autopanning, this method always sets
            the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Origin"/> to the <c>FirstInput.ViewPoint</c>,
            scrolls the view according to <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoView.ComputeAutoPanDocPosition(System.Drawing.Point,System.Drawing.Point)"/>,
            and then stops this tool.
            When manually panning, this changes the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.DocPosition"/>
            according to the difference between the mouse down and the mouse up points.
            Again, the value of <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoToolPanning.Modal"/> determines whether this tool then stops,
            or if it waits for another mouse down/up.

            Although this structure is public, it is rarely used explicitly.
            Instead you should use the <c>foreach</c> (or <c>For Each</c>) construct to
            iterate through the objects that are part of a collection.  In C#:
            <code>

              . . .
            }
            </code>
            In VB.NET:
            <code>
            Dim obj As GoObject
            For Each obj in aGoCollection
              . . .
            Next
            </code>
            <para>
            Remember that you must not modify the collection, by adding or
            removing any child objects, while you are
            iterating over the children.
            If you do, you may get an InvalidOperationException.

            <para>
            To show something in a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>, you will need to construct and initialize a
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/> (typically a class inheriting from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoNode"/> or
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoLink"/> or <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoLabeledLink"/>), and then add it to the view's
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.Document"/>, which will be an instance of <c>GoDocument</c>.
            Typical programmatic usage might be something like:
            <code>
            GoBasicNode node1 = new GoBasicNode();
            node1.LabelSpot = GoObject.Middle;
            node1.Text = "basic node 1";
            node1.Shape.BrushColor = Color.LightGreen;
            node1.Location = new PointF(75, 50);
            goView1.Document.Add(node1);
            
            GoBasicNode node2 = new GoBasicNode();
            node2.LabelSpot = GoObject.Middle;
            node2.Text = "basic node 2";
            node2.Shape.BrushColor = Color.LightYellow;
            node2.Location = new PointF(200, 50);
            goView1.Document.Add(node2);
            
            GoLink link = new GoLink();
            link.ToArrow = true;
            link.FromPort = node1.Port;
            link.ToPort = node2.Port;
            goView1.Document.Add(link);

            Please note that a <c>GoDocument</c> does not require the existence of any <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>s.
            A document may have zero, one, or many views displaying it simultaneously.
            A document and all of its <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>s must not have any references to any
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/> or to any other <c>Control</c>s.

            All documents and all of their objects must be serializable.
            Please read more about this topic in the User Guide.
            To help debug serialization issues, call the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.TestSerialization"/> method.
            </para>
            <para>
            <c>GoDocument</c> implements <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoCollection"/>, so you can call methods such as
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Add(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Remove(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Contains(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>, <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Clear"/>, and
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.CopyArray"/>, use properties such as <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Count"/>, and enumerate both
            forwards and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Backwards"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            A <c>GoDocument</c> organizes all of the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>s that it contains into
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoLayer"/>s.  The layers are held in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Layers"/> collection.
            Initially a document will only have one layer, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.DefaultLayer"/>.
            If you want to keep nodes in one layer and links in a different layer, it is conventional
            to put the nodes in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.DefaultLayer"/> and the link in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.LinksLayer"/>.
            You will need to create a new layer and assign it to that property.
            If you want have all links appear behind all nodes, you can do:
            <code>
            doc.LinksLayer = doc.Layers.CreateNewLayerBefore(doc.Layers.Default)
            </code>
            Since the layers are painted in the order in which they appear in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Layers"/>
            collection, the above code will ensure that all links are painted before any nodes or
            other objects that are in the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.DefaultLayer"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Bounds"/> of each object are in document coordinates.
            This means that the coordinates are single precision floating point values;
            the position is a <c>PointF</c>, the size is a <c>SizeF</c>, and the bounds is a
            <c>RectangleF</c>.  Each <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/> can look at some or all of the 
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>s in a rectangular area determined by the view.  The size
            of the view, the view's <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.DocPosition"/>, and the view's
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.DocScale"/> all together form the view's <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.DocExtent"/>.
            If a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>'s <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Bounds"/> is outside of a view's
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.DocExtent"/>, it won't be seen in that view.
            </para>
            <para>
            Independent of any view, a <c>GoDocument</c> has a <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Size"/> and a
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.TopLeft"/> position.  Together they form the document's <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Bounds"/>.
            Normally the document's bounds is large enough to include the bounds of all of its
            objects.  As objects are added or moved or resized, <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.UpdateDocumentBounds(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>
            extends the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.TopLeft"/> position and the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Size"/> if needed.
            (However, if <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.FixedSize"/> is true, <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.UpdateDocumentBounds(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>
            does nothing.)  The document's bounds affect whether or not a particular view's
            scroll bars are needed and how far a user might be able to scroll.  But note that
            each view has additional properties for governing scrolling extents.
            </para>
            <para>
            The document's bounds do not automatically shrink as objects are removed or are
            moved away from the edges of the bounds.  To iterate over all of the objects and
            compute the actual area that they currently occupy, call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.ComputeBounds"/>.
            You can also call the static method <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.ComputeBounds(Northwoods.Go.IGoCollection,Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/>
            to determine the extent of any collection of objects.  That method takes an optional
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/> argument to allow consideration of how much area each object
            actually takes when painted or printed in that view, since for each object the
            result of <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.ExpandPaintBounds(System.Drawing.RectangleF,Northwoods.Go.GoView)"/> may be larger than then the
            object's <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Bounds"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are a number of different possibilities for finding an object in a document:
            by location, by name, or by identifier.
            </para>
            <para>
            To find the front-most object at a given point,
            call the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.PickObject(System.Drawing.PointF,System.Boolean)"/> method.  If you might want to find all of the
            objects at a particular point, including those hidden behind/underneath, call the
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.PickObjects(System.Drawing.PointF,System.Boolean,Northwoods.Go.IGoCollection,System.Int32)"/> method.  If you want to find all of the objects that are
            either completely or partially surrounded by a rectangular area,
            call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.PickObjectsInRectangle(System.Drawing.RectangleF,Northwoods.Go.GoPickInRectangleStyle,Northwoods.Go.IGoCollection,System.Int32)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            To find a node by name, call one of the <c>FindNode</c> methods.
            <c>FindNode</c> actually will find any <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoLabeledPart"/>, not just nodes.
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoLabeledPart.Text"/> is the property that provides the text string.
            </para>
            <para>
            To find a node or port or link by integer identifier, you'll first need to set
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.MaintainsPartID"/> to true.  Then you'll be able to call
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.FindPart(System.Int32)"/> to find any <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoIdentifiablePart"/> within the
            document, at any level of nesting.
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoIdentifiablePart.PartID"/> is the property that provides the integer
            identifier.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are many properties that control whether a user can perform certain operations.
            These properties (and corresponding predicates) are defined by the interface
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoLayerAbilities"/>.  Those include: select, move, copy, resize,
            reshape, delete, insert, link, and edit.  Setting one of these <c>Allow...</c>
            properties will affect all <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoView"/>s displaying this document.
            (Setting the same properties on a view will only affect that view;
            setting the same properties on a layer will only affect all objects in that layer.)
            Call the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.SetModifiable(System.Boolean)"/> method for a convenient way to set all of
            the properties that allow modification of the document.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.IsModified"/> property indicates whether the document has been

            You will also need to override <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.ChangeValue(Northwoods.Go.GoChangedEventArgs,System.Boolean)"/> to perform the recorded
            change for that particular property.
            Similarly, if you add a property to a class inheriting from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>,
            be sure to call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Changed(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Object,System.Drawing.RectangleF,System.Int32,System.Object,System.Drawing.RectangleF)"/> if and only if the value has changed.
            You will also need to override <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.ChangeValue(Northwoods.Go.GoChangedEventArgs,System.Boolean)"/> in that class

            To record undo/redo information, assign the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.UndoManager"/> property.
            This will automatically enable undo/redo functionality in all views displaying
            this document.  If you want to make some transient changes to objects and do not
            want those changes to be recorded in the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoUndoManager"/>, temporarily

            Any code that makes changes to a document or to a document object should be

            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.FinishTransaction(System.String)"/> or <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.AbortTransaction"/>.  This groups
            together all of the changes so that an undo or a redo will perform them all at once.
            Transactions can be nested.

            When you want to (programmatically) make copies of objects and add them to a document,
            call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.AddCopy(Northwoods.Go.GoObject,System.Drawing.PointF)"/> for a single object or call
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.CopyFromCollection(Northwoods.Go.IGoCollection)"/> for multiple objects.  Calling the latter

            For document persistence, you will need to implement code to read/write to your
            desired medium.  If you are reading/writing XML, you may find GoXML useful.
            In particular, <c>GoXmlBindingTransformer</c> may be very convenient to use.
            We also offer a sample, DataSetDemo, demonstrating persistence to and from a DataSet.

            Serialization of a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument"/> and its <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>s is important
            for copy-and-paste and drag-and-drop (in Windows Forms) and for session state (in ASP.NET Web Forms).
            Sometimes copy-and-paste will result in missing objects, due to unserializable objects

            You can call this method to help debug serialization problems.
            This method serializes this document into a <c>MemoryStream</c>
            and then immediately deserializes it back into a newly copied document.
            If there is a problem, you are likely to get a <c>SerializationException</c>,
            which should give you a clue as to which class needs to be attributed <c>Serializable</c>
            or which fields need to be attributed <c>NonSerialized</c>.
            </para>
            <para>
            This method is implemented as:
            <code>
            public GoDocument TestSerialization() {
              MemoryStream memstream = new MemoryStream();
              IFormatter oformatter = new BinaryFormatter();
              oformatter.Serialize(memstream, this);
              memstream.Position = 0;
              IFormatter iformatter = new BinaryFormatter();
              return iformatter.Deserialize(memstream) as GoDocument;
            }
            </code>
            </para>
            <para>
            Because this may consume significant time and space without actually changing anything,
            do not call this method in a production environment except when investigating a serialization problem.

            Otherwise it increases the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Size"/> property and moves
            the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.TopLeft"/> point farther towards negative coordinates
            as needed to include the <paramref name="obj"/>'s bounds.
            By default this method never shrinks the document.
            Note also that this method is not called while <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.SuspendsUpdates"/> is true.
            If you do add objects or modify their bounds while <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.SuspendsUpdates"/>

            This is a two-pass process.
            In the first pass, this method copies everything, by calling
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoCopyDictionary.Copy(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/> on each object and then adding the
            object to the appropriate layer in this document.
            The layer is chosen to be one that matches the layer of the original object,
            by calling <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoLayerCollection.Find(System.Object)"/>.  If no such layer is found,
            it adds the new object to the default layer.
            The second pass checks for any objects that were delayed during the copy.
            Any such objects have their <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.CopyObjectDelayed(Northwoods.Go.GoCopyDictionary,Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>
            method called to fix up whatever is needed.

             If you add a property to a class inheriting from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument"/>,

             Although properties should be designed so that setting one property
             does not modify other properties, this is sometimes not practical.
             Nevertheless it is important to avoid having side-effects when
             the value is changing due to an undo or redo.
             One way of doing this is to copy the needed code, but not the
             auxiliary side-effecting code, from the property setter to the
             <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.ChangeValue(Northwoods.Go.GoChangedEventArgs,System.Boolean)"/> override.  Or similarly, you could define
             a method called from both the setter and the ChangeValue method,
             parameterized by whether the caller is the setter or not.
             </para>
             <para>
             But a more convenient way to achieve this is to check the
             <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.Initializing"/> property that is set to true when the
             <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.ChangeValue(Northwoods.Go.GoChangedEventArgs,System.Boolean)"/> method is being called on this document.
             You should check this property before making "unrelated" side-effects.

            If you set any <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoIdentifiablePart.PartID"/> to a non-negative integer
            before adding the object to the document, you are responsible for making

            Even when this property value is true, some objects might not be
            editable by the user because the object or its layer disallows it,
            or because the view disallows it.
            Your code can always edit objects programmatically by calling
            <c>obj.DoBeginEdit(aView)</c>.

            Just before changing the object's <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Layer"/> property

            For convenience, if the object belongs to a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup"/>,

            This method heeds the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoView.CanMoveObjects"/> property if <paramref name="sel"/>
            is this view's <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.Selection"/>, and the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.CanMove"/> predicate
            for each <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/> that is not an <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoLink"/>.
            To accomplish the move, each object's <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.DoMove(Northwoods.Go.GoView,System.Drawing.PointF,System.Drawing.PointF)"/> is called,
            to support object-specific move behavior.
            All actions take place within a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoUndoManager"/>.<see cref="F:Northwoods.Go.GoUndoManager.MoveSelectionName"/> transaction.
            This does not raise the <c>SelectionMoved</c> event;
            that event is raised by the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolDragging"/> tool's <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoToolDragging.DoMouseUp"/> method.
            If there are any duplicates in the selection, objects may get moved multiple times.
            Note that an object may be moved twice if both it and one of its parents are
            in the selection.
            </para>
            <para>
            When <paramref name="grid"/> is true, each of the non-link objects in the selection <paramref name="sel"/>
            is "snapped" to the proper location, by calling <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoView.SnapPoint(System.Drawing.PointF,Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>.
            It is always each object's <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Location"/>
            that is snapped to some point.
            However, links that are in the selection are never "snapped"; they are always moved by the
            distance that the first movable non-link object in the selection is moved, which may have
            been grid-snapped.
            This policy supports moving links without recalculating their paths, as long as their connected
            ports/nodes are all moved together by the same distance, whether those nodes are "snapped" or not.

            When you want to customize an existing "mode-less" tool, and when setting one of its properties
            is insufficient, you may need to define your own subclass of that tool or define
            your own tool inheriting from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoTool"/>.
            In order for the view to use your tool, you'll need to create an instance of
            your tool class for the view, and then you can either set <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.Tool"/>
            explicitly, or let <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolManager"/> find your tool in one of the mouse tool
            lists, such as <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.MouseDownTools"/>.
            For the latter case, you could just add an instance of your tool to one of those lists.
            But often you will not want to allow the instance of the original tool class to be used.
            This method makes it easy to replace an existing tool with a different one.
            This method searches all of the lists of mode-less tools:

            properties.
            How it adds the new link to this view's document depends on the ports.
            If both of the ports belong to <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraphBase"/>s, it adds the new link
            to the common parent <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoSubGraphBase"/> for both ports.
            Otherwise it adds the new link to the document's <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument.LinksLayer"/>.
            If the new link is <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoRoutable"/>, its <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.IGoRoutable.UpdateRoute"/>
            method is called.

            <para>
            The document serves as the container of graphical objects that you want
            to display.
            Normally you should create graphical objects (instances of subclasses of
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>) and add them to the document, in order to make them
            visible to the user.
            Although often there will be one view for each document, there are can be
            more than one view displaying the same document, or sometimes no views at all
            for a document.
            Each view will have its own state, such as scroll position and selection.
            The document holds all of the state that should be shared by all views.
            </para>
            <para>
            Setting this property to a different document will stop any ongoing editing
            in this view, clear out the selection, make this view's OnDocumentChanged method
            the event handler for the new document, and call

            <remarks>
            <para>
            This value is normally the same as <c>Document.Size</c>.
            However, a view may decide to change the extent of the document that
            the view displays.
            </para>
            <para>
            For example, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.SheetStyle"/> controls
            whether the effective document size includes not only the whole document
            but also any part of the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.Sheet"/> at the current <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.DocScale"/>
            given the size of this view control.
            </para>
            <para>
            As another example, the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.ShowsNegativeCoordinates"/>
            property, when false, restricts the view to only showing non-negative
            positions in the document.  In addition to restricting the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.DocumentTopLeft"/> property to non-negative positions,
            it adjusts this property accordingly.  This property also leaves room
            for any shadows, as specified by <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.ShadowOffset"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            This property is different from the result of <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoView.ComputeDocumentBounds"/>
            because the latter method only takes into account what objects there actually are
            in the document, whereas this property will have the same value even if the
            document is empty.
            </para>

            </summary>
            <value>
            If this value is true, the objects in the selection are actually moved
            continuously, following the mouse.
            If this value is false, the user actually drags around an image of
            the selection, and the move only happens on mouse up.
            The default value is false.
            </value>
            <remarks>
            One advantage of a false value for this property is that only one undo record
            per moved object is generated for a user's moving operation--namely the
            final one on mouse up.
            Another advantage, when this property is false, is that a user's drag of
            some objects to another window will not actually modify the source document
            due to objects moved before the pointer leaves the view.
            However, many applications will need this property to be true so as to provide
            accurate continuous feedback to the user regarding where a move or copy will
            occur, particularly when grids or other snapping behaviors are involved.
            If you have many links that are expensive to route, but have to have this
            property set to true, you might want to consider setting <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.DragRoutesRealtime"/>
            to false, to delay routing until the end of a drag.
            This property is used by <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoToolDragging"/>.

            property to refer back to the original <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.BackgroundGrid"/>.
            Since this property is used by many of this view's "<c>Grid...</c>" properties,
            all of those properties may suddenly change value as this <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoGrid"/>
            reference is changed.

            A palette is a view holding a number of objects in a grid that the user

            <remarks>
            <para>
            The spacing and positioning of the items is controlled by the

            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.GridCellSizeHeight"/>
            control the spacing between items--smaller values will allow the objects to be
            placed closer together without overlapping, but will increase the likelihood of
            unaligned columns (or rows) if the objects have different sizes.
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.GridOriginX"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.GridOriginY"/>
            control the amount of "margin" space at the top and left of the view.
            However, if <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPalette.AlignsSelectionObject"/> is true and the selection objects tend
            to be smaller than the items, this margin should be larger to accomodate those
            wider item parts (unless you want to allow them to be clipped).

            You can control whether the objects are sorted, and in what order they

            You can control the way the objects are laid out in a grid, with the
            scrollbar (if needed) either vertical or horizontal, by setting the
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoPalette.Orientation"/> property.
            Because <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoPalette.LayoutItems"/> is designed to take this view's

            This method uses <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.CreateResizeHandle(System.Int32)"/> to
            actually allocate the handle.
            The size of the handle, if not already non-zero, is determined by
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.ResizeHandleSize"/>.
            The pen and brush of the handle are determined by
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.PrimarySelectionColor"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoView.SecondarySelectionColor"/>.
            The new handle is associated with the <paramref name="obj"/> and its
            <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoHandle.SelectedObject"/> property is set to <paramref name="selectedObj"/>.
