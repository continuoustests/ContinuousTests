             This class implements a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer"/> with which you can easily
             declare a binding between XML attributes and <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/> properties,
             and which automatically makes a copy of a <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.Prototype"/> object
             when consuming an XML element for this transformer.

             The following two transformers are similar to the SimpleXmlTransformBasicNode
             and SimpleXmlTransformLink transformer subclasses defined in the remarks for the
             <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer"/> documentation.  For each <c>GoXmlBindingTransformer</c>
             you need to specify an element name, create a prototype object, and add bindings
             between attribute names and property names.

             <para>
             These two transformers produce an XML document such as:
             <code>
             &lt;graph&gt;
               &lt;node Port="0" label="Linen" color="-331546" loc="112 195" /&gt;
               &lt;node Port="1" label="DarkKhaki" color="-4343957" loc="221 155" /&gt;
               &lt;node Port="2" label="LightSteelBlue" color="-5192482" loc="237 221" /&gt;
               &lt;node Port="3" label="DeepSkyBlue" color="-16728065" loc="146 288" /&gt;
               &lt;link from="0" to="1" label="zeroone" /&gt;
               &lt;link from="1" to="2" label="onetwo" /&gt;
               &lt;link from="2" to="3" label="twothree" /&gt;
               &lt;link from="0" to="3" label="zerothree" /&gt;
               &lt;/graph&gt;
             </code>
             Note that the ports get unique identifiers, not the nodes,
             because <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.HandlesNamedPorts"/> is true.
             If you also want the nodes to get unique identifiers,
             you can set <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer.IdAttributeUsedForSharedObjects"/> to true.
             Neither identifier is at all related to an <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoIdentifiablePart"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoIdentifiablePart.PartID"/>.
             </para>
             <para>
             As special cases, there are two property names that provide special behavior.
             For the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoStroke"/>, <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoLabeledLink"/>, <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoPolygon"/>,
             and <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDrawing"/> classes, you can bind to the "Points" property
             in order to get or set the array of points used to define those shapes.
             The "Points" property is not treated specially for objects of any other type.
             </para>
             <para>
             Also as a special case for node classes, the "TreeParentNode" property binding is handled as a reference
             to another node, where the other node is considered to be the "parent" node in a tree-structured diagram.
             This supports the definition of XML that only has elements for nodes, with an implicit link from a
             "parent" node to the node whose element includes the attribute corresponding to the "TreeParentNode" property.
             The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.TreeLinkPrototype"/> property of this transformer provides a link that is copied when
             consuming such an element.  The "TreeParentNode" property is not treated specially for
             objects that are not instances of <c>IGoNode</c>.
             </para>
             <para>If you define a property binding using the special "TreeParentNode" property name,
             <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.TreeStructured"/> should not be true,
             because <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.TreeStructured"/> denotes nested XML elements,
             not the use of an attribute that refers to a node.
             It also does not make sense to have more than one attribute/property binding
             using the special "TreeParentNode" property name.
             </para>
             <code>
             // create a prototype node that is copied when consuming a "node" element

             This single transformer for <c>GoBasicNode</c> produces an XML document such as:

             Note that the nodes have identifiers, not the ports.  These identifiers are not at all
             related to an <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.IGoIdentifiablePart"/>.<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.IGoIdentifiablePart.PartID"/>.
             You can control which ports are used at each node in a tree diagram by setting
             the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.TreeParentNodePortPath"/> and <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.TreeChildNodePortPath"/>
             properties of the transformer.
             You can also control whether links go from the parent node to the child node,
             or vice-versa, by setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.TreeLinksToChildren"/> property.

             <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlWriter"/> and <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader"/> also make special provision
             for a root that is a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoDocument"/> whose Type is associated with a

             properties of transformers, such as <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.TreeStructured"/>

             <para>
             Bindings are inherited from transformers in the same manner that their corresponding Types
             inherit properties.  So if you define a transformer for a Type <c>C</c> with a binding for
             the <c>CProp</c> property, and if you define a transformer for the Type <c>D</c> that inherits
             from <c>C</c>, the elements generated or consumed for instances of Type <c>D</c> will
             automatically include an attribute for the <c>CProp</c> property.
             </para>
             <para>
             The binding mechanism uses reflection, so your application will need permission to use reflection.
             Using reflection is also slower than the equivalent functionality implemented as regular code
             that you implement in overrides of <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer.GenerateAttributes(System.Object)"/> and
             <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer.ConsumeAttributes(System.Object)"/>.

            If you want to read child (nested) XML elements and have transformer(s)

            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer.ConsumeChild(System.Object,System.Object)"/> to add those child objects to the parent object.

            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer"/> and add it to the writer and/or the reader.
            You can do this for additional <c>Type</c>s, or you can replace the transformer
            for a <c>Type</c>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Sometimes you would like to modify the behavior of a transformer but for some reason
            you are unable to inherit from that <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.IGoXmlTransformer"/>-implementing class.
            This property makes it easier to insert additional functionality into an existing
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlWriter"/> by replacing a particular <c>Type</c>'s transformer with
            your own transformer that does some stuff and then delegates the rest of the
            implementation to the old transformer that had been registered for that <c>Type</c>.
            </para>
            <para>
            For example, imagine that you are using a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlWriter"/>
            such as <c>GoSvgWriter</c> that already
            knows how to handle many <c>Type</c>s, but you want to add some attributes and
            some elements to what is generated for that <c>Type</c>.  If you cannot easily
            define your own transformer class inheriting from the <c>Type</c>'s existing 
            transformer class, you could do something such as the following to add information
            to each generated SVG element for <c>GoSubGraph</c>s.
            <code>
            public class ExtraSubGraphTransformer : GoSvgGenerator {
              public ExtraSubGraphTransformer() { this.TransformerType = typeof(GoSubGraph); }
              public override void GenerateAttributes(Object obj) {
                WriteAttrVal("extra", "attribute");
                base.GenerateAttributes(obj);
              }
              public override void GenerateBody(Object obj) {
                WriteStartElement("extra");
                WriteTextBody("element");
                WriteEndElement();
                base.GenerateBody(obj);
              }
            }
            </code>
            Then where you initialize the <c>GoSvgWriter</c>, you can replace the transformer
            for <c>GoSubGraph</c> with your own transformer that also makes use of the old one.
            <code>
              GoSvgWriter w = new GoSvgWriter();
              ExtraSubGraphTransformer egt = new ExtraSubGraphTransformer();
              egt.InheritsFromTransformer = w.GetTransformer(typeof(GoSubGraph));
              w.SetTransformer(typeof(GoSubGraph), egt);
              . . . more initialization and use of the writer
            </code>

            This override also allow you to specify that this attribute, during consumption,
            defines the identifier by which a reference object may be referred to.
            The referred-to object is typically a child <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/> of a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup"/>.
            For example, if you add a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoPort"/> to your custom <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoNode"/> class,
            but do not want to have a separate XML element defining and describing that port, you will
            still need to generate the identifier for that port so that links will be able to
            find that port.  If your node class defines a property that refers to your extra port,
            you can call this method to make sure the identifier is written for the port and that
            reading this attribute will make sure that node's port is given that identifier.

            The order in which bindings are added determines the order in which properties are set
            when the attributes are consumed.  Since setting some properties, such as the text string
            for a label, may modify the position or the location of a node, you should add the
            binding for a node's position or location last.

            <para>
            Setting the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.HandlesNamedPorts"/> property is similar to defining a shared
            attribute property path for each of the ports on a node that has a name, as returned by
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup.FindName(Northwoods.Go.GoObject)"/>.

            in order to get or set the array of points used to define those shapes.

            Also as a special case for node classes, the "TreeParentNode" property binding is handled as a reference
            to another node, where the other node is considered to be the "parent" node in a tree-structured diagram.
            This supports the definition of XML that only has elements for nodes, with an implicit link from a
            "parent" node to the node whose element includes the attribute corresponding to the "TreeParentNode" property.
            The <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer.TreeLinkPrototype"/> property of this transformer provides a link that is copied when

            You may find that nested elements are being generated for child objects for which you do
            not want separate XML elements.  This may happen, for example, when you define a transformer
            for the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/> class and for a node class that has a predefined label as
            well as a variable number of additional <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/> children.
            You have at least two choices.
            </para>
            <para>
            One choice is to replace all of those non-label <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/> child objects with
            instances of some class that inherits from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/>.  Because transformers are
            defined per type, this is an easy way to discriminate between the usages of text objects.
            Your transformer should then be defined for your custom class inheriting from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/>,
            instead of for <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/> itself.
            </para>
            <para>
            The other choice is to make the transformer for <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoText"/> smarter.
            Use a transformer inheriting from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer"/> and override the
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer.SkipGeneration(System.Object)"/> method to return true when the text object
            is actually a label handled as a node attribute, and to return false when the text object

            This property is infrequently used; but it is very handy when you want a "parent" object to
            associate attribute values with each "child" object, but those attributes are not properties
            on the "child" object.  The only pre-defined use of this property is to help save bounds or path
            information for each node or link inside a collapsed subgraph.

             <example>
             <para>
             The <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoMultiTextNode"/> class holds a variable number of items, along with
             corresponding ports for each item.  It would be natural to represent such a node in XML
             by having a fixed set of attributes corresponding to node properties, and then a collection
             of nested elements describing each of the items and their ports.
             </para>
             <para>
             However, the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoMultiTextNode"/> class is not organized such that there is a
             collection of objects (<see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoGroup"/>s) that are holding an item and its ports.
             Instead an item has the same <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.GoObject.Parent"/> as the item's port.
             The items and ports all belong directly to the node in one big collection.
             So there is no <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/> class representing an "item" for which you could
             define a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer"/>.
             </para>
             <para>
             Instead you can define an auxiliary data class that holds the information about each item.
             Here's the start of such a definition:
             </para>
             <code>
             internal class MultiTextNodeItem {  // this way requires implementing a transformer subclass
               public GoObject Item;
               public GoObject LeftPort;
               public GoObject RightPort;
             }
             </code>
             <para>
             Then one can define a transformer for <c>MultiTextNodeItem</c> and a transformer
             for <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoMultiTextNode"/> that generates nested child elements for each item
             and then consumes them by creating the appropriate <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoObject"/>s and
             adding them to the <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.GoMultiTextNode"/>.
             </para>
             <para>
             However, you can avoid having to implement a transformer class
             for <c>MultiTextNodeItem</c> if you inherit from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlSimpleData"/>
             and define real .NET properties for each property you want to store so that
             you can use <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer"/>.
             </para>
             <code>
             internal class MultiTextNodeItem : GoXmlSimpleData {  // no transformer subclass needed
               public MultiTextNodeItem() { }
               public GoObject Item {
                 get { return (GoObject)Get("Item"); }
                 set { Set("Item", value); }
               }
               public GoObject LeftPort {

               public GoObject RightPort {
                 get { return (GoObject)Get("RightPort"); }
                 set { Set("RightPort", value); }
               }
             }
             </code>
             <para>
             You can then define a <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlBindingTransformer"/> for <c>MultiTextNodeItem</c>.
             The number of attributes/properties that you decide to read/write is dependent on your
             particular application's needs, of course.  But one possibility is something like:
             </para>
             <code>

            The processing of XML elements is basically done in a single pass, but there
            is built-in functionality for a second pass to fix up references in the objects
            that were constructed.

            <para>
            You must provide type-specific customizations by supplying instances of
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.IGoXmlTransformer"/>.  Each transformer is associated with a <c>Type</c>
            (<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.IGoXmlTransformer.TransformerType"/>) and an <c>ElementName</c> string
            (<see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.IGoXmlTransformer.ElementName"/>).
            </para>
            <para>
            By default there are no transformers registered for this reader, so this
            reader is unable to actually do anything with the XML elements it sees.
            You will need to call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReaderWriterBase.AddTransformer(Northwoods.Go.Xml.IGoXmlTransformer)"/> for each class of object
            for which you want to consume XML.
            These calls to <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReaderWriterBase.AddTransformer(Northwoods.Go.Xml.IGoXmlTransformer)"/> are sometimes done in an override
            of <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReaderWriterBase.RegisterTransformers"/>, but you probably do not need to define
            a class inheriting from <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.ConsumeRootBody(System.Object)"/> does the bulk of the work to traverse the
            elements in the <c>XmlDocument</c> root, or (if <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.UseDOM"/> is false)
            just to read elements from the <see cref="P:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.XmlReader"/>.
            As this reader processes each element, it calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.ConsumeObject"/>.
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.ConsumeObject"/> calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.InvokeAllocate"/> to actually
            allocate an object, and if an object is allocated, calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.InvokeConsumeAttributes(System.Type,System.Object)"/>
            <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.InvokeConsumeBody(System.Type,System.Object)"/>, and <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.InvokeConsumeObjectFinish(System.Type,System.Object)"/>
            to actually reconstruct the rest of the object.
            </para>
            <para>
            Although most of the information that needs to be reconstructed will be held in
            attributes of the element representing an object, there will sometimes be references
            to other objects.  If you can be sure that the references will be to objects that
            have already been read, you can call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.MakeShared(System.String,System.Object)"/> to remember an object
            by a key string, and you can call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.FindShared(System.String)"/> to recover that object
            by using the same key.
            </para>
            <para>
            However, if the reference is to something that might not yet have been read and
            constructed, you can make use of the delayed-references mechanism that this reader offers.
            You can just call <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.AddDelayedRef(System.Object,System.String,System.String)"/> to remember the referring object,
            the property or other identifying string of the reference in this referring object,
            and the reference string to the referred-to object.  This reference string is the
            same as the key used to identify shared objects.
            </para>
            <para>
            Then the <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.ProcessDelayedObjects"/> method, called as a "second pass"
            after all of the elements in the XML root have been read, iterates over all of those
            delayed references, calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.FindShared(System.String)"/> to resolve the reference,
            and then calls <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlReader.InvokeUpdateReference(System.Type,System.Object,System.String,System.Object)"/> so that the transformer
            gets a chance to fix up the reference.
            </para>
            <para>
            The various <c>Invoke...</c> methods do the actual lookup for a transformer
            and invoke the respective method on the first transformer found.
            </para>
            </remarks>
            <example>
            This reader could be used as follows:
            <code>
            public void LoadSimpleXml(String path) {
              myView.Document.Clear();  // assume we're replacing current document contents
              
              GoXmlReader xr = new GoXmlReader();
              // tell the reader how to handle two kinds of elements
              xr.AddTransformer(new SimpleXmlTransformBasicNode());
              xr.AddTransformer(new SimpleXmlTransformLink());
              xr.RootObject = myView.Document;
            
              using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(path)) {
                xr.Consume(sr);
              }

            <example>
            <para>
            As an example, consider the following code adapted from the GoSvg implementation:
            <code>
              GoXmlWriter w = ...
              w.DefaultNamespace = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg";
              w.SetNamespaceUri("xlink", "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink");
            </code>
            </para>
            <para>
            The above code causes the root element to have an "xmlns" attribute.
            It also defines a prefix, "xlink", that refers to a particular namespace URI.
            The result may look like:
            <code>
              &lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
              ...
              &lt;/svg&gt;
            </code>
            </para>
            <para>
            By calling <see cref="M:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlWriter.SetNamespaceUri(System.String,System.String)"/>, you can then define a
            <see cref="T:Northwoods.Go.Xml.GoXmlTransformer"/> with code such as:
            <code>
            public override void GenerateBody(Object obj) {
              base.GenerateBody(obj);
              GoImage img = (GoImage)obj;
              Image image = img.Image;
              String id = this.Writer.FindShared(image);
              if (id != null) {
                WriteStartElement("use");
                WriteAttrVal("xlink:href", "#S" + id);
                WriteEndElement();
              }
            }
            </code>
            </para>
            <para>
            The above transformer method example is simplified from the code used
            by the SVG transformer for <c>GoImage</c>s, where there needs to be
            a link to the element representing the actual Image.
